    "### Key findings\n",
    "- I used GPT-4 models because they provide much better accuracy than GPT-3.5 models on \"out of scope\" questions when controlling for prompt length. So I used \"gpt-4-1106-preview\" despite higher costs and latency.  \n",
    "- Moving the questions very close to the instructions in the prompt made the model more likely to flag irrelevant questions as \"out of scope\" without verbose explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future opportunities \n",
    "- With GPT-3.5, irrelevant questions yielded more verbose, wandering responses. But it can still work well with fewer than 3 questions.\n",
    "- In practice, GPT-3.5 with an additional classifier could filter out irrelevant questions, either a fine-tuned small language model or a simple BERT classifier.\n",
